Replace the NA values of Mileage, Engine and Power with median
Median is the best replacement technique because it preserves the central tendency and avoids outliers
Replace the NA values of Seat with Mode. Number of seats is discrete in nature, although it is quantitative value so mode is used
As there are many null values incase of Newprice, it is better to drop a column because imputing any values can result in outliers in the data and lead to wrong analysis
